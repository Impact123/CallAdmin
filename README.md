# CallAdmin  
CallAdmin is a multilingual, modular and extendable system to allow in-game reports for HL2-Games and Mods.  

The system is based on multiple parts.  
* A multilingual, extendable sourcemod-plugin to report players in-game  
* Modules that catch reports and relay them to steam, ts3, mysql, etc
* [A Desktop Client](https://github.com/dordnung/CallAdmin-Client) to notify admins when a new report was made  
* Web scripts to make reports available from outside the game and interact with the modules and/or the client

Please take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Impact123/CallAdmin/wiki) for more information.
